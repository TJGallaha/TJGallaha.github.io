									<p>...Single buildings boast signs for four, five, or even six establishments splitting the area with makeshift curtains. Breezes carry the warmth of pastries and butter as visitors pass cafes. Cobblestone streets include well-compacted dirt paths for bubbies that need softer surfaces.</p>

                                    <p> Rather than being a nightmare of urban sprawl, the close quarters are comfortable and homey. Lucy-Fur dreamed of a city for bubbies, where every inhabitant could meet their needs with just a short flight. Neighborhoods built up over time and groups of friends established communal homes. Beelzebaby nurseries and school groups move safely through the city, learning about Puraton and the Angelbubbies as they grow.</p>

                                    <p>Tucked away in the oldest neighborhood is Lucy-Fur’s townhouse. Deciding against a palace or manor, they took up residence in the first house built. Outside, trees blossom year-round and drop pale blue petals over the brick wall. Visitors to the house can’t help but bring some home with them, and pressed flowers are kept as souvenirs of the visit. Lucky bubbies are able to see Lucy-Fur through the window, and even luckier bubbies are invited inside to meet with the angel.</p>

									<h3>When the springtime arrives... </h3>
									<p>...and the glaciers around Pagenta start to melt, the town surges in size. Fairgrounds pop up and inns offer special deals for those who want to bring a baby bubby home with them. Throughout the rest of the year, the town is a quiet retreat for those who want to enjoy the mountain lakes.

                                    The glacier itself is barely outside the formal structure of the town. In the summer, aquatic bubbies swim in the lake and arctic bubbies cool down on the ice. Most of the residents were at first tourists to the town that fell in love with it on their annual visits. With the growth of the tourism industry and newcomers deciding to move in permanently, there’s plenty of room for new businesses!

								<h3>The Ammon Forest... </h3>
									<p> ...contains remnants of the previous civilizations on Puraton. Underneath the shelter of old growth trees, bubbies live hidden from the worst of the elements. Some of the trees have been standing for thousands of years. Legend says some of the trees can speak with bubbies if a bubby invests the time into making the tree their friend. Likewise, between the safety granted by the trees and the magical energies of the forests, the bubbies here age slowly and live particularly long lives.

                                        Like most older bubbies, those that live there don't like it when outsiders cause a stir. They will allow well-behaved outsiders permission to explore what remains. Many bubbies in this forest make their homes in ruins. </p>

The gnarled trees that rise out of the shallow waters only add to the swamp’s mystique. However, in recent time, it has turned into a haven for bubbies that prefer solitude and quiet. After all, if visitors are afraid of what lurks beneath the water, they’re not likely to come by.</p>

                                    <p> The legends that surround Old Shucky focus more on the inhabitants. The place crawls with cryptids. Of course, confirmation of these bubbies is nearly impossible to come by. A small museum boasts hides and paintings of the swamp’s inhabitants. Between the questionable provenance of evidence and the low quality, proof is far from conclusive.

									<h3>When the springtime arrives... </h3>
									<p>Water-based bubbies live in tightly-knit communities built into the Iki-Iki Reefs. Between the shallow waters, the sunny days, and the seaweed forests, the reefs are one of the best places for bubbies to live! Like most reefs, they’re a living creature. While more research needs to be done regarding the precise nature of the coral, early indicators show that they have similar cellular make-up as bubbies. Perhaps the same magic used by bubbies are what keeps these reefs alive? With the living nature of the reefs, bubbies see them as a family member more than a home. It’s common to invite the reef to your party and to make sure they enjoy the refreshments!</p>

                                    <p>The reefs themselves are a stony coral with distinctive yellow coloration from the sulfur vents. Shoals provide a common meeting space for both aquatic and land-based bubbies. Anenomies, sea cucumbers and other invertebrates provide ample foraging opportunities.
